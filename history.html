            <h4>Beer in Mesopotamia</h4>
            <p>
              The people of ancient Mesopotamia enjoyed beer so much that it was
              a daily dietary staple. Paintings, poems, and myths depict both
              human beings and their gods enjoying beer which was consumed
              through a straw to filter out pieces of bread or herbs in the
              drink. The brew was thick, of the consistency of modern-day
              porridge, and the straw was invented by the Sumerians or the
              Babylonians, it is thought, specifically for the purpose of
              drinking beer.
            </p>
            <h4>Beer in Ancient Greece and Rome</h4>
            <p>
              Beer brewing traveled from Egypt to Greece (as we know from the
              Greek word for beer, zythos from the Egyptian zytum) but did not
              find the same receptive climate there. The Greeks favored strong
              wine over beer, as did the Romans after them, and both cultures
              considered beer a low-class drink of barbarians. The Greek general
              and writer Xenophon, in Book IV of his Anabasis, writes:
            </p>
            <i style="margin-inline: 2rem"
              >There were stores within of wheat and barley and vegetables, and
              wine made from barley in great big bowls; the grains of barley
              malt lay floating in the beverage up to the lip of the vessel, and
              reeds lay in them, some longer, some shorter, without joints; when
              you were thirsty you must take one of these into your mouth, and
              suck. The beverage without admixture of water was very strong, and
              of a delicious flavour to certain palates, but the taste must be
              acquired. (26-27)</i
